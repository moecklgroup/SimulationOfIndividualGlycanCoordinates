# Simulation of Idividual Glycan Coordinates

Here, we aim to provide a simulation pipeline as a starting point for future analysis of molecular resolution data in the context of the glycocalyx. We attempt to relate known structural features of the glycocalyx to topological arrangements as they might be extracted with advanced imaging methods, providing a framework for contextualizing experimental data.
